In 2011 I was supposed to [speak at MagmaRails](http://2011.magmarails.com/speakers).

At the time, I was working on Rubinius and related projects from Portland, Oregon. The whole thing was sponsored by [Engine Yard](https://blog.engineyard.com/2012/my-summer-of-open-source). In case you didn't know, they rock.

Anyhow, they would have covered my trip to Manzanillo. Would have. But then [Hurricane Jova](http://goo.gl/0WqSL) decided to cancel the event.

Three times since have I been invited to Mexico. And so far, I couldn't make it.

A few things changed since then: First, I'm back in Germany, which is a bit farther away from Mexico than the US is. And second, I no longer have Engine Yard sponsoring me. But I still work on [Open Source](/sinatra-1.4) full time. Silly me.

Doing a lot of Open Source means I get invited to [speak](/almost-sinatra) at a few conferences each year. Since [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) is by far not making enough money (yet) to cover my travel expenses or pay me enough so I can do it myself, I always insist on the conference covering the costs.

I did the same for the three invitations I've got from MagmaRails, by now called [MagmaConf](http://magmaconf.com/). However, it's not easy to find sponsors for a community organized conference in Mexico. Every time I was told that they can't cover my costs, maybe next year.

But this time we won't declare defeat that easily. Instead, we're trying to crowdfund my plane tickets with the [*Bring Konstantin to MagmaConf*](https://bring-konstantin-to.magmaconf.com/) campaign. You would make the conference organizers, the attendees and of course myself extremely happy by shipping in, even if it's just a little.

    We created this fundraiser because we believe that the Ruby community is awesome and there is a strong chance that we can reach the goal. Plus, Konstantin is pitching in with some pretty nice perks, so it's totally worth the contribution!
