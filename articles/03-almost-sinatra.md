title: Almost Sinatra

A while back I implemented a functional [Sinatra clone](https://github.com/rkh/almost-sinatra) in six
lines of Ruby code.

I recently gave a talk about this and other useless but amusing things at a conference in Melbourne
and they've just released the video:

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/61087285" width="550" height="310" frameborder="0"
webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen style="margin-bottom: 1em"></iframe>

And here are the slides:

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="fe2a38105f8d013056301231381ff75d"
data-ratio="1.33333333333333" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
